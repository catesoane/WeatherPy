Observed Trends:
1.	According to the City Latitude vs Max Temperature graph, there is a relatively strong correlation between latitude and temperature. The closer the latitude gets to 0 (the equator) the hotter the max temperature is. Similarly, the more south or north you go (away from the equator) the colder the temperatures.
2.	According to both the City Latitude vs. Humidity and the City Latitude vs. Cloudiness, there is no significant correlation between latitude and humidity or latitude and cloudiness. 
3.	Based on the data for City Latitude vs. Wind Speed, there seems to be no significant correlation between latitude and wind speed. However, the most common observation was speeds between 0 and 10 mph.
